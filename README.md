This repo is where I am sharing my modular synthesizer designs.

[See here](https://len42.github.io/Synth/) for more info.

Please note that I am a hobbyist, not a trained electronics engineer! These designs are not perfect. The modules work for me, but I can't promise they'll work for everyone who builds them.

These designs are shared as open source. See the license details in each project and source file.
