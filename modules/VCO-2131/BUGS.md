# VCO-2131 BUGS

## Output jacks wrong order

- Just fix the schematic labels and panel graphics to match.

## Octave switch middle setting FUBAR

- DNF - Don't use the middle setting! High & Low settings should cover everything.
- Change component in the schematic to a 2-position switch.

## Sub-Oscillator FUBAR

- Problem TBD
