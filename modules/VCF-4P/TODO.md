# TO BE DONE

Note: prototype4 represents current breadboard prototype (July 17)

Make a front panel PCB instead of using Delp MCS
* TODO: Controls board is already changed
* TODO: Make a matching PCB for the front panel
* TODO: Update & finish the panel graphics

What happens to the output level when the 220R resistors in the prototype are changed to 200R as in the schematic?
* TODO: Test to verify the levels are still OK

PROBLEM: Output voltage offset 0.4V - Why?? Can fix?
* Problem is in the input stage. Can't see why - maybe a ground offset somewhere?
* AC-coupling the output does not work well.
* Resolution: DNF. It's a small offset, and may go away in the real module.
