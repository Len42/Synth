# TO BE DONE

Note: prototype4 represents current breadboard prototype (July 18)

Done: Order remaining parts - see BOM

PROBLEM: J13 is misplaced slightly :(
* Done: Make the PCB fit
* Done: Fix the PCB layout
* TODO: Re-do gerbers
* Done: Note on OSHPark

PROBLEM: Output voltage offset 0.4V - Why?? Can fix?
* Problem is in the input stage. Can't see why - maybe a ground offset somewhere?
* AC-coupling the output does not work well.
* Resolution: DNF. It's a small offset, and may go away in the real module.
* TODO: Test finished module
