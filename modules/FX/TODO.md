# Breadboard Prototype

PROBLEM: FX module isn't doing what it's supposed to
- always vibrato...?!?
- does respond to controls & tap tempo
- seems to have bad connections to breadboard

Done: Adjust input gain for close to 2Vp-p
- see prototype3

TODO: Differential amp stage
- Done: hook up OUT1-
- TODO: adjust resistors for gain
- currently ~3.6V (approx double the input)

TODO: Output stage
- adjust gain & offset for correct audio output
- it a bit of offset
- maybe should be AC coupled?

Done: Both input & output should be inverting

TODO: Dry signal mix
- watch out for amplitude & offset

# PCB Prototype

TODO

Breadboard prototype doesn't work - it seems to have bad connections.

Make a more reliable PCB protype, but keep it simple.

- Use pot & resistor values similar to the datasheet
- Socket header for FX module
- Output stage gain ~2.5 (inverting)
- Wet/dry mix pot? not sure it's necessary
- Only one channel for simplicity

Should it be a Eurorack module?
- Only if it can fit on 1 PCB (but it can be ugly)
- Convenient to use standard power cable

# Module

Make it wide enough for all controls - 8 HP?
