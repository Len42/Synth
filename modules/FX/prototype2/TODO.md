TODO: Adjust input gain for close to 2Vp-p
- measured with A1 in place
- it's too low now ~1.2V
- try R4 = 33K or 47K

TODO: Differential amp stage
- hook up OUT1-
- measure output of differential amp
- test different input waveforms
- adjust resistors for gain
- look for less than normal, e.g. 5Vp-p

TODO: Output stage
- adjust for correct audio output
