# Precision Adder / Unity-Gain Mixer

## 4HP Eurorack Module

### Features
- Two 3:1 mixing channels usable for CV or audio signals
- All inputs are mixed equally, _i.e._ added together
- Precision design handles pitch CVs accurately
- Blinking lights show when a channel is active and whether it's a CV or audio signal

### Notes
The precision op-amps and resistors are relatively expensive. For a less precise, less expensive module, you can replace:
- U1, U4 with TL074
- U2 with TL072
- all 0.1% resistors with 1% resistors

PCB layouts are provided in KiCad and gerber formats. A PCB layout for a drilled front panel (with no labels) is also included.

(TBD) The PCBs that I used can be ordered from OSH Park. The designs are here:
- [Controls board](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/zzz)
- [Middle board](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/zzz)
- [Back board](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/zzz)

Please note that I am a hobbyist, not a trained electronics engineer. No guarantees!

### Software Used
