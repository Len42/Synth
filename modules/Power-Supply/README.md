# Eurorack Power Supply

This is the power supply that I made for my Eurorack modular system. It is meant to live inside the system case with the power switch and DC input jack mounted on the side of the case.

### Specs

Input: Requires between 9 V and 36 V DC, 35W (from a power brick / wall wart / laptop charger)

Output: +12 V, -12 V (1 A each), +5 V (500 mA)

### Notes

I used an old laptop charger as the AC-DC converter (power brick) so I didn't have to mess around with mains voltage. The required Eurorack voltages (+12 V, -12 V, +5 V) are supplied by switching DC-DC converters. The outputs are isolated from the input.

There are two 16-pin Eurorack power connectors; you'll want a busboard or flying-bus cable to feed multiple modules.

The power supply is assembled on a stripboard PCB. I have provided a layout diagram.

Please note that I am a hobbyist, not a trained electronics engineer. No guarantees!
