### Features
- Two separate wavefolding channels
- Channel 1 output is normalled to channel 2 input to give double the folding
- Front panel knobs control the degree of folding for each channel

### Notes
The amount of folding is controlled by the level of the input signal which is adjusted by an attenuator pot on the input. There are no CV inputs, but CV control of the folding can be done by running the input signal through a VCA.

The circuit design is based on [Ken Stone's Simple Wave Folder](http://www.synthpanel.com/modules/cgs52_folder.html) and [yusynth's Metalizer](http://yusynth.net/Modular/EN/METALIZER/).


PCB layouts are provided in KiCad and gerber formats. A PCB layout for a drilled front panel (with no labels) is also included.

(TBD) The PCBs that I used can be ordered from OSH Park. The designs are here:
- [Controls board](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/zzz)
- [Middle board](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/zzz)
- [Back board](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/zzz)

Please note that I am a hobbyist, not a trained electronics engineer. No guarantees!

### Software Used
