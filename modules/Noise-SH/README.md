- S&H can be triggered by an internal clock or external input
- Internal clock is output on the trigger jack when selected

### Notes

This module is built using the [Delptronics Module Construction Set](https://delptronics.com/module-construction-set.php) which includes PCBs for the front panel controls and other components. The PCB layout file is just a guide showing how I placed the components on the Delptronics boards. (It's a bit of a mess - sorry!)

Please note that I am a hobbyist, not a trained electronics engineer. No guarantees!
