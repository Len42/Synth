# Voltage-Controlled Digital LFO

## 4HP Eurorack Module

### Features
- Three simultaneous waveform outputs, switchable between:
    - triangle, ramp, and square, or
	- three sine waves, 120° out of phase
- CV input for LFO rate with attenuator

### Notes

This module is built using the [Delptronics Module Construction Set](https://delptronics.com/module-construction-set.php) which includes PCBs for the front panel controls and other components. The PCB layout file is just a guide showing how I placed the components on the Delptronics boards. (It's a bit of a mess - sorry!)

Please note that I am a hobbyist, not a trained electronics engineer. No guarantees!
