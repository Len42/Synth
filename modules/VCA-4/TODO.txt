Output clips at ~10 V.

Level & CV Amt Controls
-----------------------

2Shapes module output is max 8.6 V.

With Level at min, CV Amt maxes out at less than 100% gain, when fed from 2Shapes.

Level has to be up slightly for envelope to get up to 100% gain. With this setting there doesn't seem to be any audible feedthrough when envelope is off.

With no CV input, Level knob has to be around 80% to get 100% gain. OK.

Bipolar CV can be used by adjusting Level control.
