NOTES
=====

Output clips at ~10 V.

Level & CV Amt Controls
-----------------------

There is enough gain so that a CV that maxes out at +10 V can give more than 0 dB gain (with the Level control at zero).

2Shapes module output is max 8.6 V. With Level at min, CV Amt maxes out at less than 100% gain. But giving a bit of Level compensates for that, without any audible feedthrough.

With no CV input, Level knob has to be around 80% to get 100% gain. OK.

Bipolar CV can be used by adjusting Level control.

Level control max gain (with no CV) = ~13 dB
