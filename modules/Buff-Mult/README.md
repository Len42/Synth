## 4HP Eurorack Module

### Features
- Two 1:3 channels - each channel copies an input signal to three outputs
- Input of channel 1 is normalled to channel 2, making a 1:6 multiple when only one input is used
- Outputs are buffered so that they don't affect each other, unlike a passive multiple

### Notes
PCB layouts are provided in KiCad and gerber formats. A PCB layout for a drilled front panel (with no labels) is also included.

The PCBs that I used can be ordered from OSH Park. The designs are here:
- [Front panel](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/exBVN6kN)
- [Controls board](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/ZccsRBLi)
- [Main board](https://oshpark.com/shared_projects/9fD0SGfR)

Please note that I am a hobbyist, not a trained electronics engineer. No guarantees!
