## Designs for my Eurorack synthesizer modules

[This repo](https://github.com/Len42/Synth-pub) is where I am sharing my modular synthesizer designs.

Please note that I am a hobbyist, not a trained electronics engineer! These designs are not perfect. The modules work for me, but I can't promise they'll work for everyone who builds them.

These designs are shared as open source. See the license details in each source file/project.
