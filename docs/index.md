## Designs for my Eurorack synthesizer modules

<img src="https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Len42/Synth/main/docs/synth-photo.jpg" width=500px style="float:right">

My modular synthesizer designs are shared in [this repository](https://github.com/Len42/Synth).

Please note that I am a hobbyist, not a trained electronics engineer! These designs are not perfect. The modules work for me, but I can't promise they'll work for everyone who builds them.

These designs are shared as open source. See the license details in each project and source file.

## Modules

These are the modules that I have built so far:

[Envelope2](https://github.com/Len42/Synth/tree/main/modules/Envelope2) &mdash; Dual ADSR envelope module, microcontroller-based

[Wavefolder](https://github.com/Len42/Synth/tree/main/modules/Wavefolder) &mdash; Dual analog wavefolder module

[LFO-DigiVC](https://github.com/Len42/Synth/tree/main/modules/LFO-DigiVC) &mdash; Voltage-controlled LFO, microcontroller-based

[Noise-SH](https://github.com/Len42/Synth/tree/main/modules/Noise-SH) &mdash; Noise, sample-and-hold, and trigger clock, all in one module

[Power-Supply](https://github.com/Len42/Synth/tree/main/modules/Power-Supply) &mdash; Eurorack power supply using a laptop charger
